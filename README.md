Showcase basic HTML skills

This is the first project given to me in the foundational course of the odin project. I have learnt HTML basics and will be showcasing my knowledge of the directory structure, index.html, boilerplate template, opening/closing tags, elements, attributes, comments, git basics, etc.

Also, the purpose of this project is to create webpages for different recipes with photos and navigation.
