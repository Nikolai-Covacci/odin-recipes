        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Saltimbocca is a classic Italian dish made with thin slices of veal topped with prosciutto and sage, pan-fried, and finished 
            in a white wine and butter sauce. The name means “jumps in the mouth,” a nod to its bold, savory flavor. It’s traditionally 
            Roman and known for its quick cooking and rich, salty bite.

        <p>
            This version of saltimbocca uses beef instead of veal, making it more accessible while still delivering the same savory depth. 
            It skips the toothpicks by pressing the prosciutto into the meat, and the sauce is built directly in the same pan for convenience.
            The result is a faster, easier take on the classic with no loss in flavor.
