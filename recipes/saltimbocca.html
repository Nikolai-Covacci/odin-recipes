        <h2 class="h2-recipe">Description</h2>
        <p class="description-text">Saltimbocca is a classic Italian dish made with thin slices of veal topped with prosciutto and sage, pan-fried, and finished
        in a white wine and butter sauce. The name means “jumps in the mouth,” a nod to its bold, savory flavor. It's traditionally 
        Roman and known for its quick cooking and rich, salty bite.This recipe stays true to the Roman tradition by using veal, but
        emphasizes ease and speed, taking less than 10 minutes to cook.The veal is lightly floured before being pan-seared, which
        helps create a golden crust and slightly thickens the sauce. Sage and prosciutto are secured with toothpicks, adding both
        flavor and structure, while a splash of wine and butter creates a simple yet elegant finish.</p>
