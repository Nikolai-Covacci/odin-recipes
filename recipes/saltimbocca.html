        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Saltimbocca is a classic Italian dish made with thin slices of veal topped with prosciutto and sage, pan-fried, and finished 
            in a white wine and butter sauce. The name means “jumps in the mouth,” a nod to its bold, savory flavor. It’s traditionally 
            Roman and known for its quick cooking and rich, salty bite.
        </p>
        <p>
            This recipe stays true to the Roman tradition by using veal, but emphasizes ease and speed, taking less than 10 minutes to cook.
            The veal is lightly floured before being pan-seared, which helps create a golden crust and slightly thickens the sauce. Sage and 
            prosciutto are secured with toothpicks, adding both flavor and structure, while a splash of wine and butter creates a simple yet 
            elegant finish.
