        <h2 class="h2-recipe">Description</h2>
        <p>Shrimp risotto is a creamy Italian rice dish made with tender shrimp and arborio or carnaroli rice. The rice is slowly</p> 
            <p>cooked by gradually adding warm seafood broth, which gives the dish its signature creamy texture. The shrimp adds a delicate,</p> 
            <p>sweet seafood flavor that blends with the savory notes of garlic, shallots, and parsley. A bit of lemon zest is often added to</p>
            <p>brighten the dish and balance the richness. The result is a smooth, flavorful risotto that is both comforting and light,</p>
            <p>making it a popular choice for seafood lovers.</p>
