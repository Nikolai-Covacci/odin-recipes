        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Penne all'Arrabbiata is a classic Roman pasta dish known for its bold, spicy flavor. It features penne pasta tossed in a 
            simple yet fiery tomato sauce made with garlic, olive oil, and plenty of red chili peppers. The name "arrabbiata" means 
            "angry" in Italian, referring to the heat of the dish. The sauce is cooked until rich and slightly thick, then mixed with
            al dente penne to create a flavorful, satisfying meal. It's often garnished with fresh parsley and sometimes a sprinkle of 
            Pecorino Romano cheese for added sharpness, making it a favorite among lovers of spicy Italian food.
